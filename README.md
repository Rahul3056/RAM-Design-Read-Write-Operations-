### **RAM Design (Read/Write Operations)**

#### **Concept Overview**  
RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of **volatile memory** used to **store and retrieve data quickly**. It is a vital part of digital systems and is often implemented in hardware designs for temporary data storage. It supports **read** and **write** operations controlled by a **clock**, **enable**, **read/write select**, and **address lines**.

#### **Detailed Explanation**  
- **Inputs:**  
  - `clk`: Clock signal for synchronous operation  
  - `we`: Write enable â€“ when high, enables data write  
  - `addr`: Address lines to select memory location  
  - `din`: Data input (for write operation)  

- **Output:**  
  - `dout`: Data output (during read operation)  

- **Control Logic:**  
  - If `we = 1`, data at `din` is written to RAM at `addr`  
  - If `we = 0`, data from `addr` is read and sent to `dout`  

#### **Applications**  
- CPU cache memory  
- Buffer storage  
- Temporary data processing in digital systems  

#### **Execution Steps**  
1. Define parameters for address and data width.  
2. Create a memory array using `reg [DATA_WIDTH-1:0] mem [0:DEPTH-1]`.  
3. Write synchronous always block to handle read/write logic.  
4. Simulate using a testbench to verify functionality.

#### **Real-World Example for Practice**  
Design an 8x8 RAM (8 locations, each 8 bits wide) with read/write capability, and simulate a write-read sequence.

#### **Further Enhancements**  
- Add synchronous reset  
- Implement RAM with initialization from a memory file  
- Expand to 16x8 or 32x8 with parameterization
